**!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!**
**X-AUTH-TOKEN Changes every few days so if script returns error make sure that your X-AuthKey is updated** \
Each time when you execute the script it automatically deletes already downloaded photos, so you don't neeed to manually remove them.

**FAQ**
1.Is it possible to download more than 10 photos? - Unfortunately no, script shows everyone who is blurred when you hit likes section- see screenshot below

2. Does it work on MAC?
⋅⋅⋅2.1 Yes, the script works on MAC. Personally, I couldn't find the X-AUTH-TOKEN using Google Chrome on MAC, I find it by using Firefox.

**PS: I am not JS expert rather beginner so don't complain about my code, I've have chosen this language because it's easy to set up comparing to JAVA/C# (I don't know python)**
